# SemesterProject4
This is a repository for a entity component based software engineering project for our 4th semester. 



Pipeline for git commits.

Versioning, VOC: v0.0.0 is the Readme initial commit.
Rules for commits, TBD style.

All commits must contain a version and a small commit description. Example: "v0.0.3 - Implemented x on feature y.

Patch releases are to be on feature branches or small fixes on main, and should be denoted as v0.0.X

A feature branch is to be made for each feature following versioning v0.0.X.

When this feature is merged into the main branch, the feature should be versioned as v0.X.0.

First major release, written as vX.0.0, is fulfillment of all must requirements and is a working functional product.
